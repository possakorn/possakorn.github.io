## Projects
### ECommerce Churn Prediction

[Github Reporting](https://github.com/possakorn/DataScience-AcademicMaterial/blob/main/05_BigDataProject/partD_summary.pdf) & [Github Source Code](https://github.com/possakorn/DataScience-AcademicMaterial/blob/main/05_BigDataProject/implementation%20code.Rmd)

In recent years, the growth of **eCommerce** has been driven by technological advancements and shifts in shopping behavior due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing vast amounts of data, such as purchase history and customer feedback, offers businesses valuable opportunities to improve profits by investigating **churn prediction** in online shopping platform. A study using data from a Brazilian online store applied the LightGBM algorithm to identify key factors influencing customer churn by **Python** and reporting via **Overleaf**. The analysis revealed that factors such as purchase duration, spending behavior, location, and review scores were major contributors to customers leaving the platform.

### S&P500 Stock Price Prediction

[Github Reporting](https://github.com/possakorn/DataScience-AcademicMaterial/blob/main/06_Deeplearning/DeepLearning_StockPricePrediction_RNN.pdf) & [Github Source Code](https://github.com/possakorn/DataScience-AcademicMaterial/blob/main/06_Deeplearning/Code_StockPricePrediction_RNN.ipynb)

Over the past decade, machine learning techniques have made significant strides in forecasting financial time series, proving effective in various markets, including cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and major stock indices such as the S&P 500. Building on these advancements, this study evaluates Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and BiGRU, to **predict daily S&P 500** closing prices via **Python** and **Pytorch**. By normalizing and transforming the data, the models capture the non-linear dynamics of financial time series, with the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) standing out as the most effective for handling short-term dependencies and adapting to market volatility.

### Website Design


During my Masterâ€™s degree, I designed websites for small-to-medium brunch cafes in Adelaide, focusing on improving their online presence and customer engagement. These projects involved creating responsive, user-friendly designs that showcased menus, integrated **online booking**, **reservation**, **online menu**, and **streamlined customer interactions**. As shown in the picture below, the goal was to blend functionality with appealing visuals for an optimal user experience.
