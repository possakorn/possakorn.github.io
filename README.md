### Employee Performance Analytics Dashboard
This project, submitted for the Onyx Data Challenge - October 2024, analyzes employee performance metrics using Looker Studio. The interactive dashboard provides insights into performance, demographics, and work-related factors.

Dashboard Features:

- Overview Page: High-level summary of employee data to identify general patterns.
- Analytics Page: Detailed analysis of performance against factors like age, education, working hours, overtime, and assigned projects.
- Details Page: Drill-down view with filters for department, job title, and other dimensions.

Key Insights:
- Performance scores are consistently distributed across demographics and work factors.
- Salary shows a direct positive correlation with performance.
- 50% of employees enjoy remote work flexibility, with a stable attrition rate (~10%).
  
**Highlights:** KPI Summary | Demographic Breakdown | Performance Analytics | Salary & Performance Trends
