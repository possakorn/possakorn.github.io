## Work Experience
**AI Research Assistant @ University of Adelaide (_August 2024 - Present_)**
- Conducted a feasibility study comparing computer vision techniques with traditional methods to detect respirable crystalline silica dusts. Addressing its impact on construction site health hazards, this experiment focused on technical performance, cost- effectiveness, and time efficiency.
- Implemented end-to-end simulations of computer vision models for silica dust measurement, covering image preprocessing, model deployment, performance evaluation, and actionable results interpretation.

**Business Intelligence Specialist @ Hays Migration (_July 2023 - December 2023_)**
- Led the development of a case management app, integrating multiple datasets for migration and education, ensuring compliance with policies and improving data accessibility.
- Developed business strategy through performance monitoring to deliver guidelines and identify potential operational gaps, ensuring compliance with policies and regulatory requirements. By engaging with stakeholders, analysis implemented via Power Automation and Microsoft PowerBI offers reliable and valuable information for business decision-making.
- Built a business intelligence dashboard focused on migration KPIs, reducing processing time by 40% and enhancing operational efficiency with Power BI and automation tools.


## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
